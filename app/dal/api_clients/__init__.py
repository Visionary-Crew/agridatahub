"""
This package contains API clients for external data sources.

- Write code here to hit external APIs and fetch data (e.g., REST, GraphQL, etc.).
- Each client should handle authentication, request/response, and error handling for its respective API.
- Example: Fetching crop data from a government agriculture API.

Usage:
    from app.dal.api_clients.some_client import SomeAPIClient
