This package defines the core business/domain models using Pydantic.

- Use this directory to define data structures representing entities (e.g., Crop, Farmer, Field).
- Models here are used throughout the app for type safety and business logic.
- Do NOT put database or API-specific logic here.

Usage:
    from app.models.models import Crop
